# storj_earnings
Earnings calculation script for Storj V3 storagenodes

## Prerequisites
Python is required to run this script.

This script was tested on Windows 10 and Linux, with Python 3.7.
Other OS's and versions will likely also work.

### Warning
If you are running Docker on Windows or MacOS, stop the node, copy the bandwidth.db, storage_usage.db, piece_spaced_used.db, reputation.db and heldamount.db to a different location and run the script from there. Running the script on docker nodes on these OS's while the node is using it could lead to corruption of the database, which will kill the node.

## Usage
Earnings for current month:
```
python earnings.py /path/to/storj/data
```
_Note: If you omit the path it will look in the current working directory._


Earnings for previous months:
```
python earnings.py /path/to/storj/data 2019-05
```
